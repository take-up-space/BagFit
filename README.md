## About The Project

This project, named BagFit, is a full-stack application created as an experiment in vibe coding. It consists of a frontend and a backend that work together to provide a web tool designed to help travelers determine if their personal item carry-on bag will fit under the airplane seat in front of them.


## Built With

  â€¢	**Gemini** (for project planning)  
	â€¢	**Replit** (for development)  
	â€¢	**React** (for the user interface)  
	â€¢	**Express.js** (for the backend server)  
	â€¢	**TypeScript** (for the programming language)  
	â€¢	**Tailwind CSS** (for styling)  
	â€¢	**Radix UI** (for accessible UI components)  
	â€¢	**Drizzle ORM** (for database interactions)  
	â€¢	**Vite** (as the build tool)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

â€¢	**Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.  
â€¢	**Database**: This project uses a Neon serverless database. You will need to create an account and obtain a connection string from your Neon dashboard.

### Installation

1.	Clone the repository:
   
      ```
    Bash  
    git clone https://github.com/take-up-space/BagFit.git
      ```

2.	Navigate to the project directory:  
   
      ```
    Bash
    cd BagFit  
      ```
      
3.	Install NPM packages:
   
      ```
    Bash  
    npm install  
      ```

4. Create a file named `.env` in the project's root folder and add your database connection string to it. Replace `[YOUR_NEON_DATABASE_URL]` with your actual URL:
   
      ```
    DATABASE_URL=[YOUR_NEON_DATABASE_URL]  
    ```  

### Running the Project

1.	Push the database schema to your database:  
  
      ```
    Bash  
    npm run db:push  
    ```  

2.	Start the development server:

      ```
    Bashâ€¨â€¨
    npm run dev  
    ```

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: What's Live Now (MVP Complete)  
ðŸŸ¢ Verified Data: Sourced from over 25 major airlines.  
ðŸŸ¢ Bag Compatibility Checking: Instant "Fits" or "Doesn't Fit" results against an airline's under-seat policies.  
ðŸŸ¢ Popular Pet Carrier Models Database: 10+ verified bags from major manufacturers.  
ðŸŸ¢ Pet Carrier Support: Dedicated checks for airline pet carrier size restrictions.  
ðŸŸ¢ My Bags Feature: Save personal bags to your profile for quick access.  
ðŸŸ¢ Unit Conversion: Easily switch between inches and centimeters.  
ðŸŸ¢ Robust Foundation: A modern stack designed for performance and security.  


If I were to continue working on this project...

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX & Community Data ("Soon")  
ðŸŸ¡ Generalize App to All Bags: Debug the backend to enable a dropdown menu of 90+ popular personal item bags.  
ðŸŸ¡ Community Data Platform: Allow users to submit bag dimensions for the dropdown menu.  
ðŸŸ¡ Multisource Data Verification: Automatically cross-reference user dimensions against manufacturer and retailer sites to ensure accuracy.  
ðŸŸ¡ Data Expansion: Expand to 100+ global carriers and account for regional and aircraft variations.  

### Phase 3: Advanced Photo & AI Features ("Later")  
ðŸŸ  AI/AR Measurement: Use a phone camera and a reference object for AI-based dimension estimation.  
ðŸŸ  Reverse Image Search: Identify bag models from photos to retrieve manufacturer specs.  
ðŸŸ  Dimension Verification: Compare AI estimates, manufacturer specs, and community data for the most accurate dimensions.
